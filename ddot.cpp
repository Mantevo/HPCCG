/**
 * A method to compute the dot product of two vectors.
 *
 * This function optimises caching by only accessing one of the vectors if both
 * of the input values point to the same vector. `time_allreduce` is a
 * pass-by-reference variable which is updated to track the total time spent by
 * MPI's reduce function whilst collecting partial sums.
 *
 * @param n The number of vector elements (on this processor).
 * @param x The first input vector.
 * @param y The second input vector.
 * @param result A pointer to a scalar value, which is updated to contain the
 *               calculated dot product.
 * @param time_allreduce A mutable variable tracking the time spent by MPI's
 *                       reduce function.
 * @return An exit code of zero on success.
