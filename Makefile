#

#
# 0) Specify compiler and linker:

include config.mk

#CXX=
LINKER=mpicxx
#CXX=mpicxx
#LINKER=mpicxx


# 1) Build with MPI or not?
#    If you want to run the program with MPI, make sure USE_MPI is set 
#    to -DUSING_MPI

USE_MPI = -DUSING_MPI
#USE_MPI = -DUSING_MPI


# 2) MPI headers:  
#    If you:
#    - Are building MPI mode (-DUSING_MPI is set above).
#    - Do not have the MPI headers installed in a default search directory and
#    - Are not using MPI compiler wrappers
#    Then specify the path to your MPI header file (include a -I)

MPI_INC = -I/opt/amazon/openmpi/include


# 3) Specify C++ compiler optimization flags (if any)
#    Typically some reasonably high level of optimization should be used to 
#    enhance performance.

#IA32 with GCC: 
##CPP_OPT_FLAGS = -O3 -funroll-all-loops -malign-double
#CPP_OPT_FLAGS = -O3 -ftree-vectorize -ftree-vectorizer-verbose=2
CPP_OPT_FLAGS = $(CFLAGS_OPT) -g # not supported

#
# 4) MPI library:
#    If you:
#    - Are building MPI mode (-DUSING_MPI is set above).
#    - Do not have the MPI library installed a default search directory and
#    - Are not using MPI compiler wrappers for linking
#    Then specify the path to your MPI library (include -L and -l directives)

MPI_LIB = -L/opt/amazon/openmpi/lib

#
# 5) Build with OpenMP or not?
#    If you want to run the program with OpenMP, make sure USING_OMP is set
#    to -DUSING_OMP

USE_OMP = 
#USE_OMP = -DUSING_OMP

#
# 6) OpenMP Compiler argument
#    GCC and Intel compilers require -fopenmp and -openmp, resp.  Other compilers may differ.

#OMP_FLAGS = -fopenmp
#OMP_FLAGS = -openmp

#
# 7) System libraries: (May need to add -lg2c before -lm)

SYS_LIB =-lm
ARMPL_LIB = -larmpl -L/shared/arm/armpl/armpl_22.0.2_gcc-11.2/lib
#
# 6) Specify name if executable (optional):

TARGET = test_HPCCG
